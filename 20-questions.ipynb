        "### Overall Approach and Design Process\n",
        "> First, similarly to the individual homework assignment on this very topic, our code loaded the *Phi 3 mini* model from Microsoft. As instructed, we used this model to solely generate questions based on provided properties before initiating our game. We used that model to begin the long process of scoring each noun by each property, storing the results in a JSON file. For the game setup, we calculated entropy to weigh the efficacy of questions, with this being based on log base 2. Using entropy, we could determine how much uncertainty was reduced by a potential question. This uses our important technique of a tree structure. We would select the best question available each time; in theory, if we had good questions at our disposal, the max amount of questions would be log base 2 of our nouns. The game itself iterated through these reclassifications until a result or 20 questions was met.\n",
        "> Initially, we planned to use random questions, but we found performance to be lackluster. This would have included some sort of backtracking if fully fleshed out, but Jared brought up the incredible idea of using a tree structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Overall Performance\n",
        "> Wow, I think our team is very content with the performance of this project. This has been a tremendously daunting task, especially considering the fact that many groups have struggled to make a dent. In our studies, our model guessed \"Exactly Correct\" every time, as shown by our test games. Every single example of ours was able to guess the model in 11 questions. Now, as we know, 2^11 is 2048. This is the lowest power of two that hits our nouns threshold, which is right under 2000. This means our questions were fairly consistent in asking decisions that split the dataset, as evidenced in the \"Overall Approach and Design Process.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future Work and Limitations\n",
        "> For our model, we did not find many limitations, as we intentionally created it in a way that was quite \"low risk\" as it turns the problem into binary search. With that said, our way of coding does potentially limit extremely quick guesses, although I think we would all agree that this tradeoff is necessary. In a job, we would prefer the consistency of continually passing the assignment of using under 20 questions. In the future, it is possible that performance could be improved, of course, by improving the quality of questions. As many have likely noted, this particular LLM is quite limited in its understanding, so a newer LLM for question generation may result in better results. If given more time, since use of an LLM is recommended but not exclusive, I believe it would be beneficial to manually go through each generated noun-property rating. Having good, consistent answers can only ever improve performance, and I know that answers did not always seem consistent (such as rock with a weight of 4 but a bear cub with a weight of 2) during the related individual homework assignment. As well, I would further refine the accuracy of our correctness tiers."
